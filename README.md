                              ---->Survival prediction using PCA and Ensemble Learning<----


The RMS Titanic sank in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912 in the North Atlantic Ocean, four days into the ship's maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. The largest ocean liner in service at the time, Titanic had an estimated 2,224 people on board when she struck an iceberg at around 23:40 (ship's time)[a] on Sunday, 14 April 1912. Her sinking two hours and forty minutes later at 02:20 (ship's time; 05:18 GMT) on Monday, 15 April, resulted in the deaths of more than 1,500 people, making it one of the deadliest peacetime marine disasters in history.

Our dataset has details of 1309 passengers like Name , Age , Fare ,Survival etc. With help of machine learning we are going to create a model to predict survival of passengers. Keeping all previous work in concern, this project focuses on another approach of constructing an efficient model for prediction. We will use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Ensemble Learning of different models. Information contained in every column can be used through manipulating it and extracting useful one.
